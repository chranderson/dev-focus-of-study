_The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents. It provides a structured representation of the document (a tree) and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects that have properties and methods. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once that event is triggered the event handlers get executed. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages._

## Testing  

[Behavior Driven Development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)  
_a software development process that emerged from test-driven development (TDD).

[Integration Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing)  
_The phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing.

[Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/)  
_Standalone test spies, stubs and mocks for JavaScript.No dependencies, works with any unit testing framework._  

[Test Driven Development (TDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)  
_A software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards._  

[Unit Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)  
_A software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use._
